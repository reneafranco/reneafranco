 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Rene's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  Hello, my name is Rene Franco. I hold an associate degree in computer science, and I've had a deep passion for technology since my early years. I've always been fascinated by the process of building things, which led me to pursue a career in the tech industry. My primary goal is to leverage my passion for technology to create innovative tools that can benefit society.

I recently completed the Revature Pre-Training program, where I had the opportunity to showcase my strong problem-solving skills. I played a pivotal role as a team player, assisting my colleagues with technical inquiries and helping them better understand complex algorithms. During the training, we focused on creating Restful APIs and backend applications using Java, Javalin, and SQL. I also have hands-on experience with various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, Java, Spring Framework, and relational database management systems like MySQL and PostgreSQL.

My technical skillset is well-rounded and includes proficiency in web development, backend programming, and database management. In addition to my technical abilities, I possess strong leadership qualities, effective problem-solving capabilities, and excellent presentation and communication skills. I excel at working collaboratively in a team environment, and I'm committed to delivering high-quality solutions to complex challenges. My professional journey and my experience equipped me with the precise skills and confidence needed to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
